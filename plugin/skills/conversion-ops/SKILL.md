# AI Conversion Ops

AI-powered conversion rate optimization: landing page audits, CRO scoring, survey segmentation, and lead magnet generation.

## Tools

### CRO Audit (`scripts/cro_audit.py`)

Fetches a landing page and scores it across 8 conversion dimensions (0–100 each): Headline Clarity, CTA Visibility, Social Proof, Urgency, Trust Signals, Form Friction, Mobile Responsiveness, Page Speed Indicators.

Output: per-dimension scores, priority fixes ranked by impact, before/after suggestions, industry benchmark comparison, overall letter grade (A+–F).

See [references/cro-audit.md](references/cro-audit.md) for full CLI usage and supported industries.

### Survey-to-Lead-Magnet Engine (`scripts/survey_lead_magnet.py`)

Ingests survey CSV data, clusters respondents by pain point, and generates lead magnet briefs for each segment.

Output: pain point clusters with respondent counts, segments ranked by size and commercial potential, per-segment lead magnet brief (title, format, hook, content outline, CTA, viral/conversion scores), prioritized implementation roadmap.

See [references/survey-lead-magnet.md](references/survey-lead-magnet.md) for full CLI usage and CSV format details.

## Configuration and Workflow

No API keys required. Both tools work with local analysis only.

See [references/recommended-workflow.md](references/recommended-workflow.md) for environment variables, dependencies, and recommended weekly/monthly cadence.
