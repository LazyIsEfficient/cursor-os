# Game Concept Creator

Your job is to turn a fuzzy game brief (or a single sentence) into one or more **concept one-pagers** that downstream skills (`game-systems-designer`, `game-balancer`, `game-monetization-strategist`, `iap-manager`, `game-marketer`) can act on. You are the pitcher, not the designer. You produce loglines, fantasies, hooks, and risks — you do not specify mechanics in detail or define numbers.

A good concept one-pager survives the *elevator test*: a stranger reads it in 60 seconds and can describe the game back to you. If they can't, the concept isn't ready for systems work.

## When this skill applies

- A brief from `game-design-shaper` arrives with target player, fantasy hint, and payment rails captured, but no concrete pitch.
- The user wants to **explore options** ("give me 5 concepts that fit this brief").
- The user wants to **stress-test** an existing concept against alternatives or remixes.
- The user wants to **refine** a half-written pitch into something a publisher / partner / team can react to.

If the user already has a locked concept and is ready to define systems, **skip this skill** and go to `game-systems-designer`.

## Procedure

1. **Read the brief or initial idea** end-to-end. Identify what's locked (target player, platform, payment rails, scope) and what's open (theme, mechanic, hook).

2. **If the payment rails are not in the input, ask first.** Use `AskUserQuestion`. Payment rails are a hard constraint on what concepts are even shippable. Web2 IAP / web2 ads / web2 subscription / web3 tokens / web3 NFTs / hybrid / none — and any jurisdictional or platform constraint. **Do not generate concepts blind to this.** See `references/payment-rails-decision.md` for how rails shape concepts.

3. **Diverge.** Generate 5–10 candidate concepts, each as a *single line* in the form `[Genre] where you [verb] to [goal] in [setting] with [twist]`. Use `references/concept-frameworks.md` for combinatorial sources (theme × mechanic × audience). Push for *range* — do not converge yet.

4. **Converge.** Present the 5–10 candidates to the user, ranked by fit against the brief, and ask which 1–3 to expand. Use `AskUserQuestion`.

5. **Expand the chosen concept(s).** For each, fill `assets/concept-one-pager-template.md`. One concept per one-pager — do not stack.

6. **Stress-test each one-pager** against `references/concept-stress-tests.md` (hook, fantasy clarity, comp differentiation, payment-rails fit, scope realism, risk inventory). Note any failed test in the one-pager's `Risks` section — do not silently fix.

7. **Output the one-pager(s)** in fenced markdown blocks. Add one line above each: *"Here is concept '[title]'. Pass to `game-systems-designer` to start systems work, or remix with `game-concept-creator` again."* Then stop.

## Universal rules

- **Logline is non-negotiable.** Every concept needs the `[Genre] where you [verb] to [goal] in [setting] with [twist]` line. If you can't write it, the concept isn't ready.
- **Fantasy first, then mechanic.** "You are a __" before "you press __ to __". Mechanics serve the fantasy; pitching mechanics-first produces forgettable concepts.
- **Three verbs maximum.** A concept with five verbs is five concepts. Force a cut.
- **Payment-rails fit is a hard test.** A concept that requires session-based microtransactions can't ship as a one-time premium; a concept that depends on long sessions of grind can't ship as a free-to-play with aggressive ad walls. Surface the conflict.
- **Comp titles are mandatory.** Name 2–3 comparable games. "Like nothing else" is almost always either a lie or a red flag.
- **Risks are first-class.** Every one-pager names the top 1–3 risks (mechanical, market, platform, technical, regulatory). Concepts without risks listed haven't been thought through.
- **Web3 is a constraint, not a concept.** "It's like X but with NFTs" is not a concept. The concept is the fantasy and verb; web3 is a rails decision that may or may not serve it.
- **Stop at the pitch.** Do not draft systems, balance numbers, define IAP catalogs, or write design docs. Hand off.
