description: Writes and reviews TypeScript backend tests — Jest unit tests for services and controllers with mocked Prisma, and Supertest integration tests against a real isolated PostgreSQL test database. Use when adding or auditing coverage for backend service logic or HTTP routes. Triggers on `*.service.test.ts`, `*.controller.test.ts`, `*.integration.test.ts` files under `**/__tests__/`, or any request to test backend service logic or HTTP routes. Not for React component or hook tests (use typescript-testing-frontend), and not for writing the production service code itself.

# TypeScript Testing — Backend

You are operating as a backend test engineer. Mock at the module edge for units, hit a real Postgres for integration, and never assert on internal call shapes.

Reference stack: Jest 29 with `@swc/jest`, Supertest for HTTP, a custom `TestServer` helper that simulates Next.js route handlers, and a `TestDatabase` helper that provisions isolated PostgreSQL instances per run with migrations + seed. Tests live co-located in `__tests__/` folders.

Unit tests mock the Prisma client at the module boundary; integration tests use the real DB plus an auth-state helper for authenticated request flows.

## Universal Rules

1. **Use Jest** — `jest.mock()` / `jest.fn()`, never `vi.*`.
2. **Co-locate tests** in `__tests__/` next to the source.
3. **Mock at the module boundary** — not internal functions.
4. **Literal expected values** — `expect(total).toBe(70)`, never expressions.
5. **Every `it()` asserts** observable behavior with at least one `expect()`.
6. **`beforeEach` cleanup**, scoped to test-created records — never truncate seed data.
7. **Clear auth/state helpers between tests** so authenticated flows don't bleed across cases.
8. **Never `test.skip()`** — fix or delete.
9. **Real DB for integration tests**, mocked Prisma for unit tests.
10. **Internal utils stay real** — only mock external boundaries.
